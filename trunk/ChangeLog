    WRITE AND VERIFY command

    freestanding on command line or after --job=
  - show percent completed
  - add DDPT_DEF_BS environment variable
  - add iflag=ff to source 0xff bytes

  - add atomic flag for WRITE ATOMIC(16) command on OFILE
  - add warning when oflag=strunc copy interrupted

Changelog for ddpt-0.94 [20140407] [svn: r277]
  - xcopy: change default to send xcopy command to dst
    - add XCOPY_TO_SRC and XCOPY_TO_DST environment
      variables to guide where to send xcopy command
  - odx: add new offloaded copy technique, also known
    as "xcopy v2, lite", that exposes ROD Tokens
    - ddpt supports 4 odx variants: full copy, zero
      output blocks, read to tokens and write from
      tokens. Latter two facilitate network copies

    - can issue individual PT, WUT, RRTI, Report All
      Rod Tokens, and Copy Operation Abort commands
    - can decode T10 defined info in Rod Token
  - improve CL handling of short options (e.g. '-vv')
  - point svn:externals to rev 563 of sg3_utils
  - configure: add --disable-libsgutils option so
    build bypasses that library if present

Changelog for ddpt-0.93 [20131113] [svn: r242]

  - fix fifo read when bs is large
  - add delay=MS,W_MS for bandwidth limiting

  - add protect=RDP,WRP option
  - add cdbsz=32 option for READ(32) and WRITE(32)
  - add rarc flag for scsi read cdbs
  - add block flag for pt (non blocking by default)
  - fix overflow on OFILE when input fifo
  - ./configure options:
    - change --enable-no-linux-bsg to --disable-linuxbsg
    - add --disable-scsistrings to reduce utility size
      with non-libsgutils build
  - reduce ddpt.c size by adding ddpt_pt.c
  - win32: fixes for cygwin version 1.7.17 headers
    - translate O_EXCL to no sharing
  - point svn:externals to rev 522 of sg3_utils
  - upgrade automake to version 1.13.3

Changelog for ddpt-0.92 [20110217] [svn: r157]
  - when pt used on block device and discrepancy between size
    of block device and read capacity size, require force flag
  - add coe support for input block devices and regular files
  - support conv=fdatasync, conv=fsync, oflag=fdatasync and
    oflag=fsync; called at end of copy
  - allow partial writes of trailing bytes when output is
    regular file or fifo (stdout), ignore if block or pt device
  - fix stdin, stdout and fifo handling problems
  - if iflag=sparse and of=/dev/null (or not given) warn but
    set oflag=sparse and continue
  - treat unrecovered errors as partial (as dd does)
  - win32: add '--wscan' option to scan for devices and volumes
    - select SPT direct pt interface
  - add estimate of remaining time in progress signal handler
  - accept but ignore cbs= option
  - error reporting clean up
  - add AM_MAINTAINER_MODE to configure.ac to lessen build issues

Changelog for ddpt-0.91 [20100920] [svn: r121]
  - rework copy loop.
  - extend bpt=BPT to bpt=BPR[,OBPC] spare+sparse granularity
    - change BPT default to vary from 8192 to 1 depending on IBS
  - add oflag=resume logic
  - change oflag=sparse to extend regular OFILE with a final
    block write, if required
    - add oflag=strunc to also do sparse writes but to extend
      regular OFILE with ftruncate, if required
  - change 'bs=' option to set IBS and OBS; 'ibs=' and 'obs='
    can coexist but not with 'bs='. [Closer to dd semantics]
  - conv=noerror,null,resume,sparing,sparse,sync now permitted
  - add oflag=trunc and conv=trunc (default: overwrite)
    - quietly ignored if resume, needed due to sequence
  - add oflag=trim for TRIM/UNMAP on pt OFILEs
  - add iflag=self or oflag=self for self-trim
  - add oflag=nowrite to bypass writes+truncates (does trims)
  - add iflag=errblk to write bad LBAs to file
    - if sense data deficient, write a LBA range to file
  - add iflag=norcap or oflag=norcap to bypass the SCSI READ
    CAPACITY command on pt devices
  - discrepancies between ibs or obs and READ CAPACITY supplied
    block lengths abort the copy. This can be overridden by
    iflag=force or oflag=force on pt devices
  - optical memory devices (pdt=7) added to cd/dvd readers (pdt=5)
    that don't need sense valid=1 to accept info field (when > 0)
  - rework short read logic for block and regular files
  - treat linux bsg devices as implicit pt devices

Changelog for ddpt-0.90 [20100508] [svn: r85]
  - copied from sg_dd utility in sg3_utils package
  - change name from sgdd to ddpt (package and utility name)
  - ibs and obs can differ when ((ibs * bpt) % obs) == 0)
  - change 'sg_io' flag to 'pt' (for pass-through)
  - change 'dsync' flag to 'sync'; 'ssync' flag for SCSI
    SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command; add 'nocache' flag
  - 'if=IFILE' must be given, to read from stdin use 'if=-'
  - 'of=OFILE' changed to default to /dev/null (was stdout)
  - if 'nocache' flag call posix_fadvise(SEQUENTIAL) on
    input fd and posix_fadvise(DONTNEED) during copy
  - add 'fua_nv' flag
  - when multiple unrecovered errors report lowest and
    highest LBA
  - call sg_set_binary_mode() on fds (for windows)
  - resubmit pass-through reads and writes if interrupted
