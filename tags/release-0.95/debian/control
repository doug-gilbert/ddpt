Description: Copies disks, partitions and files.
 Copies files. Is specialized for cases where the source and/or
 destination is a storage device. Optionally can use a
 pass-through interface to issue SCSI READ and WRITE commands.
 Various sparse file and device handling options. Similar to
 and an extension of the Unix dd command. Also supports two
 variants of SCSI copy offload: xcopy(LID1) and the disk->disk 
 subset of xcopy(LID4) known as ODX.
