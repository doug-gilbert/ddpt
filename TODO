Some suggestions:

  - look into supporting the SCSI EXTENDED COPY command. Syntax should be
    interesting [20090320]. Done can now do XCOPY(LID1) and ODX type copies
    (with POPULATE TOKEN and WRITE USING TOKEN commands)

  - cope with MEDIUM/HARDWARE ERROR when no valid INFO field given and
    bpt>1 . Broken devices are out there [20100903]. Pretty sure this
    one is fixed now (by temporarily setting bpt=1 for rest of segment
    then returning bpt to its original value).
