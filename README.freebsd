Disk devices in FreeBSD have names like '/dev/da0' while the corresponding
pass-through devices have names like '/dev/pass0'. See the
'camcontrol devlist' command for a list of available devices (registered
with the CAM subsystem) and the mapping between "block" devices names
and the corresponding pass-through device name.
