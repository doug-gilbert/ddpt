and the configure.ac file (in the AC_INIT item).

Changelog for ddpt-0.91 [20100920] [svn: r120]
  - rework copy loop.
  - extend bpt=BPT to bpt=BPR[,OBPC] spare+sparse granularity
    - change BPT default to vary from 8192 to 1 depending on IBS
  - add oflag=resume logic
  - change oflag=sparse to extend regular OFILE with a final
    block write, if required
    - add oflag=strunc to also do sparse writes but to extend
      regular OFILE with ftruncate, if required
  - change 'bs=' option to set IBS and OBS; 'ibs=' and 'obs='
    can coexist but not with 'bs='. [Closer to dd semantics]
  - conv=noerror,null,resume,sparing,sparse,sync now permitted
  - add oflag=trunc and conv=trunc (default: overwrite)
    - quietly ignored if resume, needed due to sequence
  - add oflag=trim for TRIM/UNMAP on pt OFILEs
  - add iflag=self or oflag=self for self-trim
  - add oflag=nowrite to bypass writes+truncates (does trims)
  - add iflag=errblk to write bad LBAs to file
    - if sense data deficient, write a LBA range to file
  - add iflag=norcap or oflag=norcap to bypass the SCSI READ
    CAPACITY command on pt devices
  - discrepancies between ibs or obs and READ CAPACITY supplied
    block lengths abort the copy. This can be overridden by
    iflag=force or oflag=force on pt devices
  - optical memory devices (pdt=7) added to cd/dvd readers (pdt=5)
    that don't need sense valid=1 to accept info field (when > 0)
  - rework short read logic for block and regular files
  - treat linux bsg devices as implicit pt devices

Changelog for ddpt-0.90 [20100508] [svn: r85]
  - copied from sg_dd utility in sg3_utils package
  - change name from sgdd to ddpt (package and utility name)
  - ibs and obs can differ when ((ibs * bpt) % obs) == 0)
  - change 'sg_io' flag to 'pt' (for pass-through)
  - change 'dsync' flag to 'sync'; 'ssync' flag for SCSI
    SYNCHRONIZE CACHE command; add 'nocache' flag
  - 'if=IFILE' must be given, to read from stdin use 'if=-'
  - 'of=OFILE' changed to default to /dev/null (was stdout)
  - if 'nocache' flag call posix_fadvise(SEQUENTIAL) on
    input fd and posix_fadvise(DONTNEED) during copy
  - add 'fua_nv' flag
  - when multiple unrecovered errors report lowest and
    highest LBA
  - call sg_set_binary_mode() on fds (for windows)
  - resubmit pass-through reads and writes if interrupted
  - drop Linux raw file support
  - drop READ LONG logic (coe=2 and coe=3)
  - add write sparing support (oflag=sparing)
  - add linux bsg support
  - sg_pt_win32: define WIN32_SPT_DIRECT via config.h
  - calculate COUNT for regular files when required
  - accept 'count=-1' to mean calculate COUNT
  - accept '-V' as synonym for '--version'
  - point svn:externals to rev 334 of sg3_utils
