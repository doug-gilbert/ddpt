# Since ramdisks have 131070 blocks (in Linux) which is 2 blocks short or
# 128*1024 (2**17); blocks have 512 bytes each. That ramdisk is smaller
# than /dev/sg<n> (102400 blocks at 4096 bytes per block). This combination
# means that 131070 blocks will not fit evenly into 16383 (4096 byte)
# /dev/sg<n> blocks. So 131070 blocks is rounded down to 131064 blocks which
# does fit.
