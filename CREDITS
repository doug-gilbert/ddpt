have made contributions:

Mark Knibbs <markk at clara dot co dot uk>
        proposed write sparing and sparse writing. [20081212]
        proposed granularity control for sparing+sparse; oflag=resume
        and lazy seeks. [20100601]

Peter Allworth <linsol at zeta dot org dot au>
        original dd clone design used by sg3_utils's dd variants
